# Underwater vehicle project
Created on: 28 June 2021 by Eugene Ow and team.

## Description:
This GitHub repository is created for our juniors, to allow them to access work from their seniors and to cultivate a culture within SAUVC to always think and plan ahead. By the way if you've seen us label anything as "CBot" or "RCBot" do note that they are actually meaning "AUV" and "HUV"

CBot (Competition robot) = AUV (Autonomous underwater vehicle)

RCBot (Research & competition robot) = HUV (Hybrid underwater vehicle)
 
## Others (Reports, Presentation slides, Videos, etc.):
Since GitHub only allows up to a maximum of 25MB, we can't really include most of our stuff like the 2 videos and the word document, but do head down to this link to view and edit them.
