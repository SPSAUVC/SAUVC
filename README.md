## Description:
This GitHub repository is created for our juniors, to allow them to access work from their seniors and to cultivate a culture within SAUVC to always think and plan ahead. 

By the way if you've seen us label anything as "CBot" or "RCBot" do note that they are actually meaning "AUV" and "HUV":

CBot (Competition robot) = AUV (Autonomous underwater vehicle)

RCBot (Research & competition robot) = HUV (Hybrid underwater vehicle)
 
## Others (Reports, Presentation slides, Videos, etc.):
Since GitHub only allows up to a maximum of 25MB, we can't really include most of our stuff like the 2 videos and the word document, but do head down to this link to view and edit them.

## Lost files:
Hey no worries, if you can't find the files. You should have probably established a messaging group with your seniors by now, if you can't find anything on MSTeams and on here, just ask them. If they don't have it as well, there's a very good chance you'll have to do it out youself.

## Duplicate files:
Incase we've included anything that is duplicated (In GitHub), you should probably use the one in the ".zip" files because those are from MSTeams.
