# SAUVC
Created on: 28 June 2021 by Eugene Ow and team.

## Description:
This GitHub repository is created for our juniors, to allow them to access work from their seniors and to cultivate a culture within SAUVC to always think and plan ahead.
 
## Others (Reports, Presentation slides, Videos, etc.):
Since GitHub only allows up to a maximum of 25MB, we can't really include most of our stuff like the 2 videos and the word document, but do head down to this link to view and edit them.
