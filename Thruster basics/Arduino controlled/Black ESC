  Take Note: 
  Due to the nature of the "black" ESC being used for remote controlled toys, 
  it requires a kick-start to get it working properly. I found that in order 
  to do that you have to engage the throttle stick (Which we didn't have) to 
  the bottom position. If you would like to read more into what happen when 
  I played with the "black" ESC please read Eugene's Journal from Week 3 - 4.
